# Technical Assessment for Tech Lead position @ Amiloz üßë‚Äçüíª

## üìà Project Scope

This project is the MVP of a backend API server to simulate a loan management system.

#### üéØ Initial considerations

To simplify some of the logic involved and to keep the scope of this MVP _10-hour-technical-assessment-ish_, I made some assumptions and decisions listed next. ~~Also because I'm not a financial expert in loans logic other than from the user perspective.~~

- The term periodicity of the loans is weekly, which means the installments will start one week after the scheduled start date for a loan.
- The interest rate periodicity is also weekly.
- The loan due amount will be equally split into the installments.
- Multiple _partial_ payments are supported for a single installment. When registering a payment, it will be associated to the installment whose due date is closest, and the amount cannot exceed the installment's due amount.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Installation

#### :clipboard: Prerequisites

To install and run this project locally, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Node v20.12.2 (as specified in the .nvmrc file)
- `npm` as a package manager

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Steps to install

- First, create a `.env` file in the root folder (feel free to copy the `.env.template` file) and then set the corresponding values.

- Then feel free to run the following commands:

  ```sh
  # In project root

  nvm use       # Use Node version specified in .nvmrc
  npm install   # Install project dependencies

  # Run only if you wish to start with a fresh database
  rm -rf prisma/dev.db
  npx prisma generate
  npx prisma migrate dev
  # Otherwise, skip to next command

  npm run dev   # Run project locally
  ```

## üíª Tech stack

- **NodeJs + Express** to create the backend server and endpoints.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **SQLite** as a relational database engine.
- **Prisma ORM** for database interactions.
- **Zod** for schema-based data validation.
- **JWT - jsonwebtoken** for authentication management.

#### üîó Created Endpoints

This project is configured to use Swagger to document the endpoints based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. To access the docs page and start exploring, please go to `http://localhost:3000/docs` after booting up the server.

As per the required and optional functional requirements, this is a list of the endpoints created as part of this MVP:

##### 1. Create a user - `POST /usuarios`:

Allows the creation of a user.

- **Authentication**: For simplicity reasons, this endpoint doesn't require auth.
- **Request body**:
  ```js
  {
    "name": "Juan",
    "lastName": "Perez",
    "email": "juan@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234",
    "roleId": "roleId"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```js
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "roleId": "string"
  }
  ```

##### 2. Login - `POST /usuarios/login`:

Allows a user to login using their access credentials.

- **Authentication**: This endpoint doesn't require auth.
- **Request body**:
  ```js
  {
    "email": "juan@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```js
  {
    "token": "string"
  }
  ```

##### 3. Create offers for a user - `POST /usuarios/{userId}/ofertas`:

Allows an admin to create different offers for a user. The offers vary in settings such as amount to loan, term of loan and/or interest rate. A minimum of two offers have to be created at a time.

- **Authentication**: This endpoint can only be executed by an authenticated admin.
- **Request body**:
  ```js
  {
    "offers": [
      {
        "amount": 1000,
        "term": 6,
        "interestRate": 0.1,
        "offerStatusId": 1,
        "startDate": "2024-07-10"
      },
      {
        "amount": 1000,
        "term": 6,
        "interestRate": 0.1,
        "offerStatusId": 1,
        "startDate": "2024-07-10"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```js
  {
    "offers": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "userId": "string",
        "amount": 0,
        "term": 0,
        "interestRate": 0,
        "offerStatusId": 0,
        "startDate": "string",
        "createdAt": "string",
        "updatedAt": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

##### 4. Create a loan from an offer - `POST /usuarios/{userId}/prestamos`:

Allows a user to create a loan based on an existing offer. It creates the loan and all the installments associated with it.

- **Authentication**: This endpoint can only be executed by an authenticated **non-admin** user. An additional validation is performed to ensure the offer is associated to the authenticated user.
- **Request body**:
  ```js
  {
    "offerId": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```js
  {
    "id": "string",
    "userId": "string",
    "offerId": "string",
    "loanedAmount": 0,
    "dueAmount": 0,
    "term": 0,
    "interestRate": 0,
    "loanStatusId": 0,
    "startDate": "string",
    "createdAt": "string",
    "updatedAt": "string",
    "installments": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "loanId": "string",
        "installmentStatusId": 0,
        "dueAmount": 0,
        "dueDate": "string",
        "paidAmount": 0,
        "createdAt": "string",
        "updatedAt": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

##### 5. Register a payment for a loan - `POST /prestamos/{loanId}/pagos`:

Allows a user to register a payment for an installment associated to a loan. The payment will be registered to the installment whose due date is closest. When one or more payments cover all the installment's due amount, its status will be updated to _Complete_, otherwise it will be set to _Partial_. Similarly, if all the installments associated to a loan are completely paid, its status will be updated to _Paid_.

- **Authentication**: This endpoint can only be executed by an authenticated **non-admin** user. An additional validation is performed to ensure the offer is associated to said user.
- **Request body**:
  ```js
  {
    "amount": 100,
    "installmentId": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```js
  {
    "payment": {
      "id": "string",
      "installmentId": "string",
      "amount": 0,
      "isReverted": true,
      "createdAt": "string",
      "updatedAt": "string"
    },
    "installment": {
      "id": "string",
      "loanId": "string",
      "installmentStatusId": 0,
      "dueAmount": 0,
      "dueDate": "string",
      "paidAmount": 0,
      "createdAt": "string",
      "updatedAt": "string"
    }
  }
  ```

##### 6. Revert a payment - `POST /pagos/{paymentId}/revertir`:

Allows a user to revert an existing payment. The logic to revert the payment includes reducing the paid amount attribute from the associated installment, and updating the installment and loan statuses accordingly.

- **Authentication**: This endpoint can only be executed by an authenticated **non-admin** user. An additional validation is performed to ensure the payment is associated to said user.
- **Request body**: Not required.
- **Response**:

  ```js
  {
    "payment": {
      "id": "string",
      "installmentId": "string",
      "amount": 0,
      "isReverted": true,
      "createdAt": "string",
      "updatedAt": "string"
    },
    "installment": {
      "id": "string",
      "loanId": "string",
      "installmentStatusId": 0,
      "dueAmount": 0,
      "dueDate": "string",
      "paidAmount": 0,
      "createdAt": "string",
      "updatedAt": "string"
    }
  }
  ```

## üîú Next steps

Here's a list of future initiatives that could be beneficial to include in the project (in no particular order).

- Refine the loaning logic so that it's possible to scale and support multiple currencies.
- Setup the project for internationalization. This includes extracting all the texts from the codebase and store them in a language-based file structure so that it's accessible when expanding to other countries.
- Add tests for the endpoints and ensure coverage on the most important elements of the loan logic.
